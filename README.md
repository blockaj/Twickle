#Twickle

A thoughtful, radical approach to Twitter.

What is Twitter all about? What separates Twitter from other social media platforms? Twitter is primarily used to broadcast short pieces of *text*. Therefore, it makes sense that Twitter should be viewed through an interface **primarily**, although not only, based on text. Command-line Twitter clients serve this job nearly perfectly but do not support images, videos, or audio.

Twickle attempts to make-up for what other Twitter clients have failed to do. Provide a clean, minimalistic interface primarily based on text while supporting other forms of media so your timeline can be viewed in one continuous stream.
